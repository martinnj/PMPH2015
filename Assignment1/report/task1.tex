\section{Task 1}
Using List-Homomorphism promotions listed below (from \cite[Slide 40]{l1intro})
prove the following invariant:
\begin{verbatim}
(reduce myop e) . (map f)
          ==
(reduce myop e) . (map ( (reduce myop e) . (map f) ) ) . distr_p
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The promotions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item (map $f$) . (map $g$) $\equiv$ map($f$ . $g$)
  \item (map $f$) . (reduce (++) []) $\equiv$ (reduce (++) []) . (map (map $f$))
  \item (reduce $\odot$ $e_\odot$) . (reduce (++) []) $\equiv$ (reduce $\odot$ $e_\odot$) . (map (reduce $\odot$ $e_\odot$))
\end{enumerate*}

\begin{verbatim}
(reduce myop e) . (map f)

(reduce myop e) . (map f)               . (reduce (++) []) . distr_p # From assignment tip

(reduce myop e) . (reduce (++) [])      . (map (map f))    . distr_p # By 2

(reduce myop e) . (map (reduce myop e)) . (map (map f))    . distr_p # By 3

(reduce myop e) . (map ((reduce myop e) . (map f)) )       . distr_p # By 1
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The last line is the form that we wished to create and we have proven
that the invariant holds.
