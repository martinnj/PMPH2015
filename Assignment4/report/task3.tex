\section{Task 3}
\subsection{Task 3.a}
% Classify the misses with respect to cold, replacement, true sharing, and false sharing misses.
% Cold = Block was never referenced before
% Replacement = Block was evicted earlier because the cache was full or because another block mapped to that cache line.
% True sharing = Two procesors access same word in a block, one gets a miss/invalidated from other.
% False sharing = Tw oprocessors access different words in same block, one still gets invalidated from other.

% Example at slide 58 in L6.

The values $A$, $B$ and $C$ recide in block $B1$ and $D$ reside in block $B2$,
both blocks map to the same cache line. Table \ref{tab:t3a} shows the different
operations and their respective misses.

\subsection{Task 3.b}
% Which of the misses could be ignored and still guarantee that the execution is correct?
The False-Sharing miss at time $6$ could be ignored and the execution would
still be able to continue without problems.
