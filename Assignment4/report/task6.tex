\section{Task 6}
% Given a n-by-n tori and an n-dimensional hypercube decide things for node
% count 4, 16, 64, 256

\subsection{Task 6.a}
% At what scale does the hypercube provide (strictly) higher bisection width than the torus?

Table \ref{tab:t6a} shows the bisection width of each network at the given
sizes, the width of the hyper-cube have a strictly greater width at $n=16$ and
higher.

$n=4$   & $8$   & $8$                         \\
$n=16$  & $32$  & $32768$                     \\
$n=64$  & $128$ & $9.223372037\times 10^{18}$ \\
$n=256$ & $516$ & $5.789604462\times 10^{76}$

\subsection{Task 6.b}
% Determine the network diameter and the switch degree for the scale at which the hypercube
% provides a higher bisection width than the torus.

% Scale: n=16.
% Network Diameter: 16 for both.
% Switch degree: 4 for tori 16 for hyper-cube.

Using the formulas from \cite[slide 38]{l7Interconnect} for scale $n=16$, the
network diameter is $16$ for both the tori and the hyper-cube. The switch degree
is 4 for the tori and 16 for the hyper-cube.

\subsection{Task 6.c}
