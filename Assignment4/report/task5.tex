\section{Task 5}
% We Consider a 16-by-16 torus (tori) interconnection network and determine the following
% interconnection network properties:
Given a n-by-n tori where $n=16$, determine the requested properties.

\subsection{Task 5.a}
% network diameter
The network diameter is $16$.


\subsection{Task 5.b}
% bisection bandwidth, assuming that each link has a bandwidth of 100 Mbits/s
Bisection width is $2n = 32$, this is multiplied by the link bandwidth giving a
bisection bandwidth of $32 \cdot 100\text{Mb/s} = 3200\text{Mb/s}$.

\subsection{Task 5.c}
% the bandwidth per node
Each node have 4 links with each $100\text{Mb/s}$ giving a total bandwidth per
node of $400\text{Mb/s}$.
