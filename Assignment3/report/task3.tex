\section{Task 3: Dense Matrix Multiplication}
The code for this assignment can be found in the \textit{src/Task3} folder
handed in with this report. All functions (where applicable) have been templated
so the datatype contianed in the matrices can be any class \texttt{T}.

The code ships with a make file that supports the \texttt{clean},
\texttt{compile} and \texttt{run} targets. The current setup of the file will
run both GPU kernels on an assymetric matrix and compare to the CPU runs.

\subsection{Task 3.a: Sequential CPU Code}
The code for this task is mainly found in the \textit{cpuFunc.cu.h} file, like
earlier it contains a number of convinience functions as well as the
multiplication function \texttt{flatMatrixMultiply}.

\subsection{Task 3.c: Naive GPU Code}
The code for this task is found in the \textit{gpuFunc.cu.h} file, it contains
the same convinience functions as earlier, but the kernel is now replaced with
\texttt{flatNaiveMutliplyKernel}, which is a naive matrix multiplication kernel.

\subsection{Task 3.d: Shared-Memory GPU Code}
The code for this task is found in the \textit{gpuFunc.cu.h} file, the
shared-memory kernel is implemented in the function
\texttt{flatSharedMultiplyKernel}.
